LIGHT-DARK or USER-HOST or CLIENT-SERVER

single-session

layout of variant is separate from the rules/script; the layout of piles is of no concern to DARK

DARK knows nothing of ebiten or gg

LIGHT is really stupid. It's passed an entire baize of cards,
and lerps the difference between old and new.

Q&A
===
Q. Is the Baize transport object going to be *Baize or Baize?
A. *Baize

Q. Pile.Placeholder()
A. In LIGHT, this needs recreating everytime Pile.Label/Baize.Recycles is updated
	Stock is a special case (uses rune based on Baize.Recycles)
	Cell, Reserve are special cases (they draw nothing)
	LIGHT is going to need a switch Pile.Category

Q. Is Statistics LIGHT or DARK?
	Dark needs it for sorting "All by Played"
	Light needs it to display to user
	Dark knows when a game is complete, so it can record to json
A. DARK

Q. Are preferences LIGHT or DARK?
A. They are LIGHT
	But DARK must be told of PowerMoves
	SafeCollect, AutoCollect, can be API calls from Light to DARK

Q. MirrorBaize?
A. Entirely up to LIGHT, as the relative positions of piles don't change, only slot positions and fan type
	...implies need for LIGHT to hold copies of DARK Slot() and FanType()
	... may require help from DARK to do the undo push, restart, undo pop

Q. Start a new deal?
A.

Q. Change variant?
A.

Q. AutoCollect?
A. LIGHT can call Baize.Collect(safe bool) (replaces sol.Baize.AfterAfterUserMove)
	BUT
	Collect() should only be done while idle
	because Collect() is like the user doing a few card taps
	and so will invoke DARK AfterUserMove and LIGHT AfterMove

Q. DARK settings?
A. Maybe have a darkSettings struct
	containing PowerMoves, SafeCollect, AutoCollect?
